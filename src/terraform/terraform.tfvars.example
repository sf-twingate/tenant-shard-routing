# Example Terraform variables for tenant routing with WASM
# Copy this to terraform.tfvars and update with your values

# Required: Your GCP project ID
project_id = "your-gcp-project-id"

# Required: Resource name prefix
# Useful for shared/playground environments to avoid conflicts
name_prefix = "tenant-routing"  # or "yourname-tenant-routing" for shared envs

# Optional: GCP region and zone
# region = "us-central1"
# zone   = "us-central1-a"

# Optional: Domain for SSL certificate
# The SSL certificate will be created for this domain and *.domain
# domain = "example.com"

# Optional: List of shards to create
# Each shard gets its own ALB with path-based routing
# shard_names = ["shard1", "shard2"]  # add more as needed: ["shard1", "shard2", "shard3", "shard4"]

# Optional: Filter implementation
# Set to true to use Lua filter with tenant lookup service (recommended)
# Set to false (default) to use WASM filter
# use_lua_filter = false

# Example for shared/playground environment:
# project_id  = "my-playground-project"
# name_prefix = "jdoe-tenant-routing"  # Use your initials/name to avoid conflicts
# domain      = "demo.example.com"     # Or use IP-based testing
# shard_names = ["shard1", "shard2", "shard3"]
